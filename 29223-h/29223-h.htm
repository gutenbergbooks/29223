<h2><a name="Major_Rogers" id="Major_Rogers"></a>
MAJOR ROBERT ROGERS</h2>
<h3>(1727-1795)</h3>


<p>Robert Rogers, a soldier of fortune, is the <i>Davy Crockett</i> of
Colonial times. Born at Dumbarton, New Hampshire, on
November 17th (some authorities say 1730, another 1731, while
the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> says 1727), he was the son
of James Rogers, a farmer living in a frontier cabin at Methuen,
in upper Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Robert's boyhood was spent in an atmosphere characteristic
of pioneer life. He had scarcely passed his fifteenth year (Nevins
claims in 1746), when he helped withstand an attack of Indians
near his home, and this may be considered his first active experience
with the Red Man. From this time on, the history of the
career of Robert Rogers is the history of the efforts of the Colonists
against the Indians as far west as Detroit, and as far south
as South Carolina. The necessity which confronted all of the
Colonists made of young Rogers one of the most expert hunters
of the period, and in this connection he was associated with the
famous John Stark, of Green Mountain Boys reputation. In the
latter's Memoir, written by Caleb Stark, we have as graphic a
pen-picture of Rogers, the hunter, at twenty-two, as we have
actual likenesses of Rogers in the pictures of the time.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Evidently Rogers flourished financially at this period, for we
find him buying land in Massachusetts in 1753. His activity
as a soldier in the French and Indian War put him in command
of a company, known as "Rogers' Rangers," and he participated
in the Siege of Detroit against Pontiac and the French. This
experience of his must have fired Rogers with the desire, after
careful consideration of the condition of the Indian, to put his
special plea for the cause of the Red Man in some permanent
literary form, for "Ponteach" was published in 1766, after Rogers
had left America, had gone to London, and thence had taken
vessel for Algiers, where he fought under Dey.</p>

<p>By 1761, Rogers had so far advanced in worldly standing that
he could afford to turn his attention to family affairs. We find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
him visiting Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Elizabeth,
daughter of the Reverend Arthur Browne, lived. The two were
married on June 30th of that year; but evidently there was
about Robert Rogers something his father-in-law did not quite
relish. For, in 1763, a dispute arose between the two, because
of Rogers' increasing dissipation. That they did not reach,
however, any immediate open rupture, may have been due very
largely to the fact that Rogers was becoming quite a land-owner
in New York and New Hampshire. It was not until March 4,
1778, after Rogers had gone through many and varied experiences,
not the least of which was serving a term in the Debtors'
Prison in England, that his wife was granted, by the New Hampshire
Legislature, a decree of divorce. She thereupon married
Captain John Poach.</p>

<p>Naturally, most of the interest attached to Rogers is historical,
not literary. His career in the French and Indian War, outlined
by him in his "Journal of the French and Indian War," which
was published in London in 1765; his activity in the Cherokee
War in South Carolina;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> his association with William Bird, when
he had an opportunity of studying the methods of Indian guides;
his political ambitions when he returned to England in 1765&mdash;all
of these are matters for the historian, and have received adequate
consideration by Francis Parkman and other writers.
During these activities, Rogers was not idle with his pen. He
kept his Journals, and they clearly reveal how much of a ranger
he was. After the fashion of the times, when he returned to
England, anxious to let his friends know of the conditions in
America, he not only published his Journals (1769), but also a
concise account of North America (1770). But there must have
been something about Rogers as a soldier of fortune that was
not as straight or as honest as <i>Davy Crockett</i>. We find him, for
example, entrusted with the post of Governor of Mackinac, and
conducting affairs so illy that he was tried for treason. He may
have advanced as a soldier through the successive ranks to
Major, but it would seem that the higher up he advanced in
position the more unscrupulous he became.</p>

<p>After serving his term in the Debtors' Prison, which began on
June 14, 1773, he returned to America, at the beginning of the
Revolution. Among his Colonial friends, he not only counted
John Stark, the ranger, but Israel Putnam as well, both of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
ardent patriots and upholders of the American cause. It would
seem, in 1775, that Rogers, to all outward appearance, was
himself in sympathy with America. He professed being the
staunch lover of those principles which America was upholding.
But General Washington soon had cause to doubt his loyalty,
and he was watched. With the result that his arrest was ordered,
and thereupon he confessed his adherence to the Crown. Rogers
then joined the forces of General Howe, bringing with him an
invaluable knowledge of the land in New York and New Jersey,
and adjacent territory. He was put in command of a company,
known as the "Queen's Rangers," and throughout the Revolution
fought bravely on the opposing side. After returning to
England, he battled for further recognition, but never received
the full honours he courted. He died on May 18, 1795, in South
London.</p>

<p>"Ponteach" was probably never given in Rogers's time. There
is no record of its even having been considered by any of the
theatrical companies. It was published in 1766, with a London
imprint on the title-page.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> There is some slight probability that
it was given an amateur production at Lake George by the summer
residents there&mdash;certainly an appropriate spot to present a
play by Rogers, inasmuch as the Ranger was known in that
neighbourhood, and there is now familiar to all visitors a place
called "Rogers's Slide," marking one of his escapades with the
Indians.</p>

<p>In the present collection, the editor has followed the text of
the 1766 edition, fully realizing the consistent changes made by
Mr. Allan Nevins in his edition of the play which, with an Introduction,
Biography, and invaluable historical notes, was published
in 1914 by the Caxton Club of Chicago.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>This piece is one which is not only interesting as representative
of the early type of Indian drama in America, but it is also interesting
as reflective of the attitude of a dramatist with a problem
to propound. "Ponteach" is our first American problem play.
Parkman claims that at least part of it was written by Rogers,
thus throwing doubt on his entire claim to authorship. There
is not only a dignity displayed in the drawing of the main char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>acter
of the Indian, but there is a very na&iuml;ve attempt at subtle
humour in the characters of the Englishmen. There is no distinct
excellence in depicting Indian character as such, after the
romantic manner of Cooper, although Rogers, with his English
tradition, has been able to lend to his dialogue a certain dignity of
diction which is striking, and which gives the play a decided
literary value. Taken, however, as an historical document&mdash;and
Mr. Nevins does this&mdash;one can trace in "Ponteach" the
whole range of Rogers's experience as an Indian fighter. There
are constant allusions in the text to matters which Mr. Nevins
has found necessary to explain in copious footnotes, and therefore
to the student I would recommend this single edition of the play.
"Ponteach" is published here, not from a scholarly standpoint,
but simply as an example of early Indian drama.</p>

<p>Of these Indian dramas, there are many examples in the
early history of American playwriting. Laurence Hutton has an
entertaining chapter on the subject in his "Curiosities of the
American Stage," in which he enumerates such titles as "Oroloosa,"
"Oroonoka," "Miautoumah," to say nothing of "Hiawatha."
"Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags" was
brought to success through the powerful acting of Edwin Forrest,
December 15, 1829. William Wheatley, of the Park Theatre,
was likewise famed for his Indian impersonations. Among other
more or less well-known plays of the species, enumerated by
Wegelin, are:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. Deffenbach.</span> "Onliata; or, The Indian Heroine." Philadelphia.
1821.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Doddridge.</span> "Logan: The Last of the Race of Skikellemus,
Chief of the Cayuga Nation." Buffalo Creek, Brooke
Co., Va. 1823.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">G. W. P. Custis.</span> "The Indian Prophecy." A National Drama
in Two Acts, founded on a most interesting and romantic
occurrence in the life of General Washington. Georgetown.
1828.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathaniel Deering.</span> "Carrabasset; or, The Last of the Norridgewocks."
